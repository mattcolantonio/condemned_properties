This repo contains information on a project concerning condemned properties in the City of Pittsburgh.
The code contained was used to extract and create variables as well as model factors of property condemnation.

Data comes from 
  - the US Census American Community Survey (code for downloading using API included),
  - City of Pittsburgh GIS files (for condemned properties and slope information) 
  - and Regrid, a parcel data service. I was generously granted access to parcel data for Allegheny County. 

Code for creating and combining variables/datasets is included as well.

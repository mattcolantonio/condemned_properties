This repo contains information on a project concerning condemned properties in the City of Pittsburgh.
The code contained was used to extract and create variables as well as model factors of property condemnation.

Data comes from 
  - the US Census American Community Survey (code for downloading using API included),
  - City of Pittsburgh GIS files (for condemned properties and slope information) 
  - and Regrid, a parcel data service. I was generously granted access to parcel data for Allegheny County. 

Code for creating and combining variables/datasets is included as well. 
The order in which scripts should be run:
1. properties_data_merged.R (combines different parcel and property information)
2. census_and_parcel.R (adds census demographic data to parcel dataset using Census API)
3. spatial_variable_creation.R (creates distance from condemned datapoint, incorporates slope dataset built in QGIS)
4. all_vars_cleaning.R (cleans up the dataset that includes all variables)
5. logit_model.Rmd (some logit models for determining property condemnation)
